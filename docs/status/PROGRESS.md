## Phase 5: Rate Limiting & Device Registration

**Status**: ✅ Completed

### Overview

Implemented comprehensive rate limiting across all services and added device registration functionality to support IoT device management.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Gateway Service Rate Limiting**
  - Per-IP connection rate limiting (60/min default)
  - Per-user connection rate limiting (30/min default)
  - Per-connection message rate limiting (50/sec default)
  - Configurable via environment variables
  - File: `gateway-service/src/rate_limiter.rs`

- [x] **Auth API Rate Limiting**
  - Per-IP login attempt limiting (10/min default)
  - Per-IP registration limiting (5/hour default)
  - Per-IP device registration limiting (10/hour default)
  - File: `auth-api/src/rate_limiter.rs`

- [x] **Device Registration API**
  - POST `/devices/register` - Register new IoT device
  - POST `/devices/list` - List user's devices
  - POST `/devices/revoke` - Revoke device access
  - API key generation with Argon2id hashing
  - Device metadata storage in SQLite

- [x] **Connection Tracking**
  - Real-time connection metadata tracking
  - Messages sent/received counters
  - Connection duration tracking
  - IP address and user agent logging
  - File: `gateway-service/src/connection.rs`

- [x] **Prometheus Metrics**
  - `gateway_connections_total` - Total connections
  - `gateway_connections_active` - Active connections
  - `gateway_messages_total` - Messages processed
  - `gateway_message_latency_seconds` - Latency histogram
  - `gateway_rate_limit_hits_total` - Rate limit violations
  - File: `gateway-service/src/metrics.rs`

- [x] **Docker Compose Setup**
  - Multi-service orchestration
  - Prometheus metrics collection
  - Grafana dashboards
  - Volume persistence
  - Health checks

### Security Improvements (Phase 5)

| Improvement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Rate limiting | Prevents brute force and DoS attacks |
| Device API keys | Secure device authentication |
| Connection tracking | Audit trail for connections |
| Metrics observability | Real-time security monitoring |

## Phase 4: ESP32 Firmware & WSS Integration (IoT Edge Hardening)

**Status**: ✅ Completed

### Overview

Implemented secure ESP32 firmware using the modern `esp-idf-svc` ecosystem for IoT edge devices. The firmware establishes encrypted WebSocket connections to the Unhidra backend with device authentication and automatic reconnection.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Created firmware directory structure**
- [x] **Implemented Wi-Fi management using EspWifi**
- [x] **Implemented secure WebSocket client**
- [x] **TLS certificate verification**
- [x] **Device authentication via Sec-WebSocket-Protocol**

| Certificate pinning ready | CA bundle with custom cert support |
| Authentication isolation | API keys in protocol header, not URL |
| Reconnect resilience | Automatic recovery with backoff |
| Memory safety | Rust ownership model, no raw pointers |
| Secure config | Credentials in .env (gitignored) |

- [x] **Graceful connection termination**
  - Send close frame with reason code
  - Clean up connection state
  - Log disconnection events

- [x] **Rate limiting for WebSocket connections**
  - Limit connections per IP

## Phase 2: Architectural Decoupling (ML IPC Sidecar Isolation)

- [x] Implemented length-prefixed JSON protocol
- [x] Created Python inference worker daemon
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling
- [x] Integrated into workspace

### Architecture Benefits

- **Event Loop Protection**: Python ML runs in separate process
- **GIL Bypass**: Separate process means no Python GIL contention
- **Fault Isolation**: Python crash doesn't bring down Rust server
- **Independent Scaling**: Can spawn multiple Python workers if needed
- **Security**: UDS is local-only, socket permissions set to 0600

- [x] Created database migration
- [x] Comprehensive test suite

### Security Improvements

- Memory-hard password hashing (resists GPU/ASIC attacks)
- 128-bit random salt per password (CSPRNG)
- Constant-time verification (timing attack protection)
- PHC-formatted strings (self-documenting hash format)
